""" Description: 

Guess the Number is a single-player game where the player is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback to the player if their guess is too high or too low until they correctly guess the number.

Example :

Welcome to the Guess the Number game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. Can you guess what it is?
Enter your guess: 50
Your guess is too high. Guess again.
Enter your guess: 25
Your guess is too low. Guess again.
Enter your guess: 37

Your guess is too high. Guess again.

Enter your guess: 31

Congratulations! You guessed the number correctly!

 


Instructions
 

Use the 'input' function to prompt the player to enter their guess as a string.
Use the 'int' function to convert the player's guess to an integer.
Use the 'import' statement to import the 'random' module.
Use the 'random.randint()' function to generate a random integer between 1 and 100.
Use an 'if/else' statement to check if the player's guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Use the 'print' function to provide feedback to the player based on their guess.
Use a 'while' loop to continue prompting the player for guesses until they correctly guess the number.
Note: 

The game can be customized to allow the player to choose the range of numbers or the number of guesses they are allowed before they lose the game. """
