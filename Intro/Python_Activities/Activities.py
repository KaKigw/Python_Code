# Activity 02: Raindrops
""" Your task is to convert a number into a string representing sounds of raindrops based on its potential factors. A factor is a number that divides another number evenly, without leaving a remainder. The simplest way to check if a number is a factor of another is by using the modulo operation.

The rules for raindrops are as follows: if a given number:

has 3 as a factor, add "Pling" to the result.
has 5 as a factor, add "Plang" to the result.
has 7 as a factor, add "Plong" to the result.
has none of 3, 5, or 7 as factors, the result should be the digits of the number itself.
Examples:

28 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be "Plong."
30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be "PlingPlang."
34 is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be "34." """

""" ## Challenge: Student Result Calculator

ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**: Create a Python program that allows a student to input their marks and calculates their final result.

1. Define the coefficients of the three main courses:
   - `maths`: 5
   - `computer science`: 3
   - `sports`: 1

2. Prompt the student to enter their **marks** for each course (on /20). Make sure to convert the input to `float`.

3. Define a **function** that takes the marks and calculates the **overall mark** using the formula:

$$
\text{overall mark} = \frac{(\text{maths} \times 5 + \text{computer science} \times 3 + \text{sports} \times 1)}{5 + 3 + 1}
$$



4. Use an **if condition** to determine if the student **succeeded** (overall mark â‰¥ 10) or **failed** (mark < 10).

5. Create a `Student` **class** with the following:
   - Attributes: `name`, `overall_mark`, `status`
   - Method `__str__()` to return:  
     `"StudentName has Succeeded/Failed with an overall mark of X"`

6. At the end, **print** the result using the class and method.
